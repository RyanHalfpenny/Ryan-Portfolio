      <h2 class="header">About Me</h2>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I am a recent college graduate (Marketing and Business Systems &
          Analytics ) from La Salle University. I managed to accrue nearly 1 year of work experience. I had the privilege of
          working for Frank Recruitment Group in a Digital Marketing Recruitment role, where I learned valuable professional
          skills such as client relations, customer retention, and direct sales. In both my academic and professional life,
          I have been consistently praised as hard-working by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic,
          extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven organizational and multitasking skills, which I hope to
          leverage into a new role. I recently started the Coding Boot Camp at the University of Pennsylvania and hope to
          equip myself with advanced front and back end coding skills.</p>
